To modify the entityPermissionUtils module to split server-specific and shared utilities, you can follow these steps:

1. Rename the existing `entityPermissionUtils.ts` file to `entityPermissionUtils.server.ts`. This file will contain server-specific utilities.

2. Create a new file called `entityPermissionUtils.shared.ts` for shared utilities that can be used in both client and server environments.

3. Move the `areTheySiblingEntitites` function from `entityPermissionUtils.server.ts` to `entityPermissionUtils.shared.ts`.

4. Update import statements across the codebase to reference the correct files:
   - For server-specific utilities, use: `import { ... } from '@calcom/lib/entityPermissionUtils.server'`
   - For shared utilities, use: `import { ... } from '@calcom/lib/entityPermissionUtils.shared'`

5. Review the functions in `entityPermissionUtils.server.ts` and determine if any other functions could be moved to the shared file. If so, move them and update imports accordingly.

6. Ensure that the server-specific file only contains functions that rely on server-side dependencies or operations.

By following these steps, you'll create a clear separation between server-specific and shared utilities, improving the overall structure and maintainability of the codebase."
